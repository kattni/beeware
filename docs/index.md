# Welcome to the BeeWare Tutorial!

**Write Python. Run Anywhere.**

Welcome to BeeWare! In this tutorial, we're going to build a graphical
user interface using Python, and deploy it as a desktop application, as
a mobile application, and as a single page web app. We'll also look at
how you can use BeeWare tools to perform some of the common tasks that
you'll need to do as an app developer, such as testing your app.

We know this isn't ideal, but we felt that a bad translation was better
than no translation at all.

# What is BeeWare?

BeeWare is not a single product, or tool, or library - it's a
collection of tools and libraries, each of which works together to help
you write cross platform Python applications with a native GUI. It
includes:

- [Toga](https://toga.beeware.org), a cross platform widget toolkit;
- [Briefcase](https://briefcase.beeware.org), a tool for packaging
  Python projects as distributable artefacts that can be shipped to end
  users;
- Libraries (such as [Rubicon ObjC](https://rubicon-objc.beeware.org))
  for accessing platform-native libraries;
- Pre-compiled builds of Python that can be used on platforms where
  official Python installers aren't available.

In this tutorial, we'll be using all these tools, but as a user,
you'll only need to interact with the first two (Toga and Briefcase).
However, each of the tools can also be used individually - for example,
you can use Briefcase to deploy an app without using Toga as a GUI
toolkit.

The BeeWare suite is available on macOS, Windows, Linux (using GTK); on
mobile platforms such as Android and iOS; and for the Web.
