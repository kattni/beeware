"The Toga Web backend is the least mature of all the Toga backends. It\\'s "
"mature enough to show off a few features, but it\\'s likely to be buggy, and "
"will be missing many of the widgets that are available on other platforms. "
"At this point in time, Web deployment should be considered a \\"
"\"Proof of Concept\\\" - enough to demonstrate what can be done, but not "
"enough to be relied on for serious development."

"The process of deploying as a single-page web app follows the same familiar "
"pattern - you create the application, then build the application, then run "
"it. However, Briefcase can be a little bit smart; if you attempt to run an "
"application, and Briefcase determines that it hasn\\'t been created or built "
"for the platform being targeted, it will do the create and build steps for "
"you. Since this is our first time running the app for the web, we can "
"perform all three steps with one command:"
