"To compile iOS applications we'll need Xcode, which is available for free "
"from [the macOS App "
"Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Once Xcode is"
" installed, launch it from Applications and accept the Xcode License "
"Agreement. Next, Xcode will show which components are built-in, and which "
"components you may download. Select the checkbox next to iOS (followed by "
"the current version number), and then click \"Download and Install\" to "
"install it. Xcode will install the system components, followed by the iOS "
"Simulator."

"Once we've got Xcode and the iOS simulator installed, we can take our "
"application and deploy it as an iOS app."

"The process of deploying an application to iOS is very similar to the "
"process for deploying as a desktop application. First, you run the `create` "
"command -but this time, we specify that we want to create an iOS "
"application:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this completes, we'll have a `build/helloworld/ios/xcode` directory "
"containing an Xcode project, as well as the support libraries and the "
"application code needed for the application."

"You can then use Briefcase to compile your app using `briefcase build iOS`:"

"We're now ready to run our application, using `briefcase run iOS`. You'll be"
" prompted to select a device to compile for; if you've got simulators for "
"multiple iOS SDK versions installed, you may also be asked which iOS version"
" you want to target. The options you are shown may differ from the options "
"show in this output - at the very least, the list of devices will likely be "
"different. For our purposes, it doesn't matter which simulator you pick."

"This will start the iOS simulator, install your app, and start it. You "
"should see the simulator start, and eventually open your iOS application:"

"While the app is running, you'll see a series of Simulator log output "
"messages in the console. Typing Ctrl+C into the terminal will halt the "
"messages in the console, but it will not close the simulator. This is so you"
" can test new changes without restarting the simulator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you know ahead of time which iOS simulator you want to target, you can "
"tell Briefcase to use that simulator by providing a `-d` (or `--device`) "
"option. Using the name of the device you selected when you built your "
"application, run:"

"If you have multiple iOS versions available, Briefcase will pick the highest"
