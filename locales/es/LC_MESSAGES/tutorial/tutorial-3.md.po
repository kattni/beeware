msgid ""
"So far, we've been running our application in \"Developer mode\". This makes"
" it easy for us to run our application locally - but what we really want is "
"to be able to give our application to others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, we don't want to have to teach our users how to install Python, "
"create a virtual environment, clone a git repository, and run Briefcase in "
"developer mode. We'd rather just give them an installer, and have the "
"application Just Work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Briefcase can be used to package your application for distribution in this "

msgid "Creating your application scaffold"

"Since this is the first time we're packaging our application, we need to "
"create some configuration files and other scaffolding to support the "
"packaging process. From the `helloworld` directory, run:"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You've probably just seen pages of content go past in your terminal... so "
"what just happened? Briefcase has done the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It **generated an application template**. There's a lot of files and "
"configurations required to build a native installer, above and beyond the "
"code of your actual application. This extra scaffolding is almost the same "
"for every application on the same platform, except for the name of the "
"actual application being constructed - so Briefcase provides an application "
"template for each platform it supports. This step rolls out the template, "
"substituting the name of your application, bundle ID, and other properties "
"of your configuration file as required to support the platform you're "
"building on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not happy with the template provided by Briefcase, you can provide"
" your own. However, you probably don't want to do this until you've got a "
"bit more experience using Briefcase's default template."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It **downloaded and installed a support package**. The packaging approach "
"taken by Briefcase is best described as \"the simplest thing that could "
"possibly work\" - it ships a complete, isolated Python interpreter as part "
"of every application it builds (except for Linux native system package "
"builds). This is slightly space inefficient - if you have 5 applications "
"packaged with Briefcase, you'll have 5 copies of the Python interpreter. "
"However, this approach guarantees that every application is completely "
"independent, using a specific version of Python that is known to work with "
"the application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, Briefcase provides a default support package for each platform; if "
"you want, you can provide your own support package, and have that package "
"included as part of the build process. You may want to do this if you have "
"particular options in the Python interpreter that you need to have enabled, "
"or if you want to strip modules out of the standard library that you don't "
"need at runtime."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Briefcase maintains a local cache of support packages, so once you've "
"downloaded a specific support package, that cached copy will be used on "
"future builds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As noted above, when Briefcase packages an app as a native Linux system "
"package (the default package format for Linux), a support package is not "
"included with the app. Instead, the app will use the Python that is provided"
" by the distribution of Linux being targeted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It **installed application requirements**. Your application can specify any "
"third-party modules that are required at runtime. These will be installed "
"using `pip` into your application's installer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It **Installed your application code**. Your application will have its own "
"code and resources (e.g., images that are needed at runtime); these files "
"are copied into the installer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It **installed your resources needed by your application.** Lastly, it adds "
"any additional resources that are needed by the installer itself. This "
"includes things like icons that need to be attached to the final application"
" and splash screen images."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this completes, if you look in the project directory, you should now "
"see a directory corresponding to your platform (`macOS`, `linux`, or "
"`windows`) that contains additional files. This is the platform-specific "
"packaging configuration for your application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building your application"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can now compile your application. This step performs any binary "
"compilation that is necessary for your application to be executable on your "
"target platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS, the `build` command doesn't need to *compile* anything, but it "
"does need to sign the contents of binary so that it can be executed. This "
"signature is an *ad hoc* signature - it will only work on *your* machine; if"
" you want to distribute the application to others, you'll need to provide a "
"full signature. :::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once this step completes, the `build` folder will contain a "
"`helloworld-0.0.1` folder that contains a mirror of a Linux `/usr` file "
"system. This file system mirror will contain a `bin` folder with a "
"`helloworld` binary, plus `lib` and `share` folders needed to support the "
"binary. :::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the `build` command doesn't need to *compile* anything, but it "
"does need to write some metadata so that the application knows its name, "
"version, and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid "::: {.admonition} Triggering antivirus"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since this metadata is being written directly in to the pre-compiled binary "
"rolled out from the template during the `create` command, this may trigger "
"antivirus software running on your machine and prevent the metadata from "
"being written. In that case, instruct the antivirus to allow the tool (named"
" `rcedit-x64.exe`) to run and re-run the command above. ::: :::: :::::::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Running your app"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can now use Briefcase to run your application:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will start to run your native application, using the app bundle created"
" by the `build` command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You might notice some small differences in the way your application looks "
"when it's running. For example, icons and the name displayed by the "
"operating system may be slightly different to those you saw when running "
"under developer mode. This is also because you're using the packaged "
"application, not just running Python code. From the operating system's "
"perspective, you're now running \"an app\", not \"a Python program\", and "
"this is reflected in how the application appears."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before continuing, close the app. As with previous tutorial steps, you can "
"do this by pressing the close button on the application window, by selecting"
" Quit/Exit from the application's menu, or by typing **Ctrl+C** in the "
"terminal where you ran `briefcase dev`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Building your installer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can now package your application for distribution, using the `package` "
"command. The package command does any compilation that is required to "
"convert the scaffolded project into a final, distributable product. "
"Depending on the platform, this may involve compiling an installer, "
"performing code signing, or doing other pre-distribution tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `dist` folder will contain a file named `Hello World-0.0.1.dmg`. If you "
"locate this file in the Finder, and double click on its icon, you'll mount "
"the DMG, giving you a copy of the Hello World app, and a link to your "
"Applications folder for easy installation. Drag the app file into "
"Applications, and you've installed your application. Send the DMG file to a "
"friend, and they should be able to do the same."

"In this example, we've used the `--adhoc-sign` option - that is, we're "
"signing our application with *ad hoc* credentials - temporary credentials "
"that will only work on your machine. We've done this to keep the tutorial "
"simple. Setting up code signing identities is a little fiddly, and they're "
"only *required* if you're intending to distribute your application to "
"others. If we were publishing a real application for others to use, we would"
