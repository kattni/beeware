"The Toga Web backend is the least mature of all the Toga backends. It's "
"mature enough to show off a few features, but it's likely to be buggy, and "
"will be missing many of the widgets that are available on other platforms. "
"At this point in time, Web deployment should be considered a \"Proof of "
"Concept\" - enough to demonstrate what can be done, but not enough to be "
"relied on for serious development."

"The process of deploying as a single-page web app follows the same familiar "
"pattern - you create the application, then build the application, then run "
"it. However, Briefcase can be a little bit smart; if you attempt to run an "
"application, and Briefcase determines that it hasn't been created or built "
"for the platform being targeted, it will do the create and build steps for "
"you. Since this is our first time running the app for the web, we can "
"perform all three steps with one command:"

"This web app is a static website - a single HTML source page, with some CSS "
"and other resources. Briefcase has started a local web server to serve this "
"page so your browser can view the page. If you wanted to put this web page "
"into production, you could copy the contents of the `www` folder onto any "
"web server that can serve static content."

msgid ""
"But when you press the button, you're running Python code... how does that "
"work? Toga uses [PyScript](https://pyscript.net) to provide a Python "
"interpreter in the browser. Briefcase packages your app's code as wheels "
"that PyScript can load in the browser. When the page is loaded, the "
"application code runs in the browser, building the UI using the browser DOM."
" When you click a button, that button runs the event handling code in the "
"browser."

"Although we've now deployed this app on desktop, mobile and the web, the app"
