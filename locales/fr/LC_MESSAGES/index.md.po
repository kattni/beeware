"Welcome to BeeWare! In this tutorial, we're going to build a graphical user "
"interface using Python, and deploy it as a desktop application, as a mobile "
"application, and as a single page web app. We'll also look at how you can "
"use BeeWare tools to perform some of the common tasks that you'll need to do"
" as an app developer, such as testing your app."

msgid ""
"BeeWare is not a single product, or tool, or library - it's a collection of "
"tools and libraries, each of which works together to help you write cross "
"platform Python applications with a native GUI. It includes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "[Toga](https://toga.beeware.org), a cross platform widget toolkit;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"[Briefcase](https://briefcase.beeware.org), a tool for packaging Python "
"projects as distributable artefacts that can be shipped to end users;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Libraries (such as [Rubicon ObjC](https://rubicon-objc.beeware.org)) for "
"accessing platform-native libraries;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pre-compiled builds of Python that can be used on platforms where official "
"Python installers aren't available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this tutorial, we'll be using all these tools, but as a user, you'll only"
" need to interact with the first two (Toga and Briefcase). However, each of "
"the tools can also be used individually - for example, you can use Briefcase"
" to deploy an app without using Toga as a GUI toolkit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The BeeWare suite is available on macOS, Windows, Linux (using GTK); on "
"mobile platforms such as Android and iOS; and for the Web."
